RATIONAL ROSE 98 ENTERPRISE EDITION CRACKED
   Rational Rose 98 provides unparalleled support for the Unified Modeling
   Language (UML). The UML allows analysts, software architects, and
   developers to specify, visualize, and document any object-oriented
   system. By providing a common "language" for speaking about a complex
   system, the UML allows many different contributors with diverse
   perspectives to communicate on common ground. Key Rational scientists,
   including Grady Booch, Ivar Jacobson, and Jim Rumbaugh led the authoring
   of the UML standard.
   The Object Management Group (OMG) accepted Rational's submission of
   the UML and adopted it as the official standard for software design
   notation.
